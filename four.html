        <p class="about">Beckham was selected by the New York Giants with the 12th overall pick in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft. Beckham signed a contract with the Giants on May 19, 2014. After missing a majority of the training camp, preseason, and the first four games of the season because of a hamstring injury, Beckham made his debut on October 5, 2014, against the Atlanta Falcons recording four receptions for 44 yards and a touchdown.In his first Monday Night Football game against the Indianapolis Colts, Beckham caught 8 passes for 156 yards. Against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10, he caught 7 passes for 108 yards. On November 23, 2014, during a game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday Night Football, Beckham had 10 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns, including a one-handed touchdown reception hailed as the "catch of the year", with Cris Collinsworth, Tony Dungy, Victor Cruz and even NBA superstar LeBron James all saying that it was one of the best catches ever. Beckham made this catch despite a pass interference penalty called on Dallas cornerback Brandon Carr while diving backwards with full extension of his right hand using only three fingers. The Giants still lost due to a touchdown throw from Tony Romo to Dez Bryant.On December 8, 2014 the Pro Football Hall of Fame put Beckham's game-worn jersey from his famous one-handed catch game against Dallas on display.</p>
